# bootstrap_jiri initializes a root directory for jiri.  The following
# directories and files will be created:
#   <root_dir>                         - root directory (picked by user)
#   <root_dir>/.jiri_root              - root metadata directory
#   <root_dir>/.jiri_root/bin/jiri     - jiri binary
#
# The jiri sources are downloaded and built into a temp directory, which is
# always deleted when this script finishes.  The <root_dir> is deleted on any
# failure.

$ export PATH=myroot/.jiri_root/bin:$PATH
$ cd myroot
$ jiri import manifest https://example.com/manifest
$ jiri update'
